We Are on a Journey

Wherever you are,and whoever you may be,there is one thing in which you and I are just alike at this moment,and in all the moments of our existence.We are not

at rest; we are on a journey.Our life is a movement,a tendency,a steady,ceaseless progress towards an unseen goal.We are gaining something,or losing something,everyday.

无论你身在何方，也无论你是何人，此时此刻，于你我之间，恰恰有着一个共同点，而这也存在于我们生活的每时每刻。我们不曾驻足休憩，只因我们身在旅途。生命就是一场运动，一种趋向，目标坚定而不懈地前进。每一天，我们都有得有失。

Even when our position and our character seem to remain precisely the same,they are changing.Got the mere advance of time is a change.It is not the same thing to have a bare field in January and in July.The season makes the difference.The limitation in the child are childish in the man.

即便你我的位置和品位看似丝毫未变，其实他们正处于变化之中。时光的流逝本就是一种改变，正如季节之变造就了春夏之田的景象各异。孩童的天真烂漫加之于成人身上就只能称之为弱稚。

Everything that we do is a step in one direction or another.Even the failure to do something is in itself a deed.It sets us forward or backward.The action of the negative pole of a magnetic needle is just as real as the action of the positive pole.

人生中的每一步都是向着既定目标迈进。纵使失败，也有所得。失败可以催人奋进，也可令人萎靡不振。磁针负极的磁性和正极同样真实。

To decline is to accept—the other alternative.

拒绝即接受，不过是另一种选择而已。

Are you nearer to your port today than you were yesterday?Yes,--- you must be a little nearer to some port or other; for since your ship was first launched upon the sea of life,you have never been still for a single moment; the sea is too deep,you could not find an anchorage if you would; there can be no pause until you come into port.

相比昨日，今天的你是否离港湾更近了一步呢？是的，你肯定是更接近某个港湾了，因为自从你驾船开始驶入人生的海洋起，你就从未停止过航行；大海如此深邃，即便你想泊船，也无法找到停泊之地；你得一直航行，直至驶入你的港湾。

All we can do is our best, and sometimes the best we can do is to start over.
我们只能尽力而为，有时候我们能做的一切就是从头开始。
